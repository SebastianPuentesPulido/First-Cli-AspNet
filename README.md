# My First Program Cli in C# :smiley: 

## **NOTE:** This is a test for my experience in this language, It is not a big thing and it is very small, I base myself on a tutorial made by Mr. @FaztTech in a tutorial on introduction to this new language.

# Download Code And Instaling  :hammer_and_wrench:
This project obviously requires dotnet core, only this program is necessary, Visual Studio is not necessary, it is only for testing but you can modify, improve, compile it and you are totally free to do whatever you want with the code.
```
$ Git Clone https://github.com/SebastianPuentesPulido/First-Cli-AspNet.git
$ cd MyCli-C#
$ dotnet restore
$ dotner run
```

(●__●) I am not very expert in this language, in general I take comfort in other development environments but for me it is very well done and I will continue studying it in the future, even so I will continue uploading more things about other languages.

# Objective :chart_with_upwards_trend:	
At first I wanted to create a CLI that could interact with the user and based on their answers propose results about cryptocurrencies and give a result, I know that there are some obsolete parts of the code but I would appreciate if you solve them or solve them in the future, I am very new to this industry but I want to keep learning, by the way this program makes use of the [Coingecko](https://www.coingecko.com/) API.
